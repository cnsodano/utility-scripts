## Explaining Analysis
analysis.py is the main script to run the zipper sort demonstration. It draws on helper functions from utils.py to import the data, clean it, normalize it for comparison, sort according to two priorities (currently "price" and "rating" of Amazon items) and save the data in /data/processed.
