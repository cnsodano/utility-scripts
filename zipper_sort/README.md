## Zipper Sort
Simple proof of concept to test out 'zipper-sorting' a database by balancing two (or more) sorting criteria when sorting the results. Test case: sorting Amazon search results to fall in order not just of cheapest->priciest nor in order of highest rating->lowest rating, but to be a mixture of both.

More information on how the data was collected, cleaned, and analyzed can be in found in the src_code and data folders' README's respectively
